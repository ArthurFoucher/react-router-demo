This is a demo project using React Router.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Nice to remember:
* API calls recommended to be in componentDidMount
* Inline style uses {{}} and camelCase atttributes
* Spreading props to pass children ({...props})
* <Router /> wraps around parts included in routing
* exact prop to match url exactly
* Route accepts component or render (function)
